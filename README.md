In this project we tried various different models to test their accuracy on plant disease classification.

Dataset used:
Images of Rice, Wheat, and Bean plants with various diseases, organized for classification.

Models Used:
Custom made CNN model 
VGG16 model 
ResNet50 model 
CrossViT-15-240 transformer model 

Results:
Among all the models, CrossViT-15-240 achieved the highest classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN and CNN-based pretrained architectures (VGG16,Â ResNet50).
